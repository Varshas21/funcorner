                                src="https://image.shutterstock.com/image-vector/aries-zodiac-signs-girl-600w-722672023.jpg"

                </div>
                <div id="c1">You're the first sign of the zodiac and love to get your way. Unfortunately, you experience
                        financial frustrations early in the year when Venus is retrograde. You want to level up in life
                        but feel stuck. Thankfully, when Venus, the planet of abundance, enters your sign in May, you're
                        ready to make bank. Plus, the lucky planet Jupiter enters your sign, Aries, bringing blessings
                        to your love life and career. 2022 is a great year to go first.</div>
        </div>

        <div id="div2">
                <div id="i2"><img
                                src="https://image.shutterstock.com/image-vector/taurus-zodiac-signs-girl-600w-722671999.jpg"
                                height="250px" width="250px alt=" taurus" />
                </div>
                <div id="c2">Sure, darling Taurus, your ruling planet Venus is retrograde when 2022 begins, but don't
                        let that get you down. Frankly, it would be best to focus on the eclipses that occur on the
                        Taurus/Scorpio axis throughout the year. These will be times of significant change, but it's all
                        pushing you towards your destiny. When the independent planet Uranus conjuncts the North Node in
                        your sign, Taurus, you receive a major push from the universe to transform into a more evolved
                        version of yourself </div>
        </div>

        <div id="div3">
                <div id="i3"><img
                                src="https://image.shutterstock.com/image-vector/gemini-zodiac-signs-girl-600w-722672014.jpg"
                                height="250px" width="250px" alt="gemini" />
                </div>
                <div id="c3">Your ruling planet, Mercury, goes through four of its infamous retrogrades this year,
                        Gemini. You're still as desired as ever, so always double-check that your work emails are
                        typo-free and that you're sexting the right sidepiece. But when the asteroid Ceres, which is
                        associated with marriage, delicious food, and the home, enters your sign, you find yourself
                        feeling more concerned with home and family life than partying. The summer should be especially
                        romantic for you, as the lover planet Venus dances through your sign. </div>
        </div>

        <div id="div4">
                <div id="i4"><img
                                src="https://image.shutterstock.com/image-vector/cancer-zodiac-signs-girl-600w-722672236.jpg"
                                height="250px" width="250px" alt="cancer" />
                </div>
                <div id="c4">You're ruled by the moon, and as a result, are sensitive, intuitive, and throw fabulous
                        dinner parties. Your emotional depth is your strength, and don't let anyone tell you otherwise.
                        Just make sure to double down on self-care this year, especially during the eclipses in fellow
                        water sign Scorpio, as this energy can make you paranoid. 2022 isn't all stressful, however. The
                        latter half of the year brings blessings on the love and financial front.</div>
        </div>

        <div id="div5">
                <div id="i5"><img
                                src="https://image.shutterstock.com/image-vector/leo-zodiac-signs-girl-600w-722672008.jpg"
                                height="250px" width="250px" alt="leo" />
                </div>
                <div id="c5">Leo, you lovely lion, you will get so many things that you want this year. Because your
                        ruling planet is the sun, the spotlight always seems to shine on you, and that's just how you
                        like it. So just make time to factor in cat naps during 2022 because two solar eclipses will
                        shake up your world. The theme for these eclipses is transformation, so while they may feel
                        hectic, you'll end up on top (and maybe with a new job or love interest). Oh, and Leo, don't cut
                        that gorgeous mane during Venus retrograde. </div>
        </div>

        <div id="div6">
                <div id="i6"><img
                                src="https://image.shutterstock.com/image-vector/virgo-zodiac-signs-girl-600w-722671984.jpg"
                                height="250px" width="250px" alt="virgo" />
                </div>
                <div id="c6">You're the healer of the zodiac, Virgo. As a result, you tend to put more effort into
                        taking care of others rather than yourself. But don't forget that the tarot card associated with
                        your sign is the hermit. Sometimes, you have to withdraw to focus on yourself. Your ruling
                        planet, Mercury, is all over the place in 2022, so an extra dose of self-care will do you well.
                        Retreating to refocus doesn't mean that you're doomed to be alone. This year, especially around
                        your birthday, brings surprises and blessings to your love life. </div>
        </div>

        <div id="div7">
                <div id="i7"><img
                                src="https://image.shutterstock.com/image-vector/libra-zodiac-signs-girl-600w-722671993.jpg"
                                height="250px" width="250px" alt="libra" />
                </div>
                <div id="c7">When 2022 begins, your ruling planet, Venus, is retrograde. Because the planet rules love,
                        beauty, and abundance, it's easier to feel as if you shine dimmer during this time. But you
                        don't at all; it's just a time to regroup and re-establish your goals regarding love and money.
                        Because when the year ends, with marriage-oriented asteroid Ceres in your sign, you will feel
                        like the shinest earthling in the world. </div>
        </div>

        <div id="div8">
                <div id="i8"><img
                                src="https://image.shutterstock.com/image-vector/scorpio-zodiac-signs-girl-600w-722672026.jpg"
                                height="250px" width="250px" alt="scorpio" />
                </div>
                <div id="c8">Your intensity is a blessing and a curse, Scorpio. On the one hand, you're mysterious and
                        so charismatic you put a spell on people. On the other, you can be jealous and sometimes even
                        manipulative. The 2022 eclipses fall on the Scorpio/Taurus axis, which means that these chaotic
                        moments will affect you more than most. However, if you can get through the eclipses without
                        picking fights, you'll end the year like a phoenix, which is considered the highest evolution of
                        a Scorpio.</div>
        </div>

        <div id="div9">
                <div id="i9"><img

                                height="250px" width="250px" alt="sagittarius" />
                </div>
                <div id="c9">Let's be honest, Sagittarius. With lucky Jupiter as your ruling planet, nearly every year
                        is a good year to be the archer of the zodiac. But when Jupiter, which rules growth, expansion,
                        and higher learning, goes retrograde during the second half of 2022, you finally have to face
                        the false narratives in your life. And yes, that may mean finally blocking your toxic ex's phone
                        number.</div>
        </div>

        <div id="div10">
                <div id="i10"><img

                                height="250px" width="250px" alt="capricon" />
                </div>
                <div id="c10">You're a natural-born leader, and fine, you're almost always right. People look at
                        Capricorns and assume that they have everything put together, and that's the image you like to
                        present. But this year, when your ruling planet, strict Saturn, is in independent Aquarius, you
                        have to prioritize yourself. How much of your happiness is sincere, and how much depends on the
                        opinions of others? Answering that question is your 2022 goal, you devilish sea-goat. </div>
        </div>

        <div id="div11">
                <div id="i11"><img

                </div>
                <div id="c11">The planet Saturn, which rules government structures and responsibility, is in your sign
                        this year, Aquarius. You're the rebel of the zodiac, and as the water-bearer, it's your job to
                        fight injustice. 2022 sees everyone else trying to get on your level thanks to your influence on
                        the usually-stodgy Saturn. But while you're out there trying to save the world, Aquarius, don't
                        forget about yourself. And you need to pay attention to your personal life, because when it
                        comes to money and love, 2022 is one for the record books.</div>
        </div>

        <div id="div12">

                </div>
                <div id="c12">You're perhaps the most emotionally deep and psychic sign of the zodiac, Pisces, but that
                        blessing can also be a burden. In 2022, you finally find healthy and effective ways to manage
                        the stress and anxiety of having such knowledge. The messenger planet Mercury teaches you how to
                        stand up for yourself, and when your ruling planet, Neptune, goes retrograde, the stars snip out
                        the losers in your life for you.</div>
