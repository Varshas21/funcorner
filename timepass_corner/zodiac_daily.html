        <div id="c1">Declutter, simplify, minimise. This is your mantra today, Aries! Whether you buy into the
            Marie Kondo lifestyle or any alternative trend, it’s a day of close examination. Think of it as an
            opportunity to look at the aspects of your life that are simply there because they’ve been there rather than
            adding any actual value. Sometimes we need to clear space out physically and internally to allow for
            something new to come in. You’re the maker of your own destiny, remember that!</div>
    </div>

        </div>
        <div id="c2">It’s not always easy to disconnect from the world. The good news is, you don’t have to! When it
            feels like the world is getting too chaotic, find a way to hold on stronger to your composure. 'Mediation in
            the marketplace' is a mantra you want to consider, Taurus. How can you move with more grace and flow in
            these times? The Universe has a way of putting your resolve to the test. </div>
    </div>

        </div>
        <div id="c3">As kids this seems like the simplest thing to do. However, when we grow up, asking for help becomes
            the most daunting task. Ask yourself this today: what’s the worst that could happen? The thing is, you
            already
            have people around you who are more than willing to support you in the way you need. All you have to do is
            reach
            out.Let fear be the last thing on your mind today. You deserve to receive help, you don’t need to do it all
            on
            your own.</div>
    </div>

    <div id="div4">
        <div id="i4"><img

                height="250px" width="250px" alt="cancer" />
        </div>
        <div id="c4">In the golden words of Lorde, “Can you reach me? No, you can’t.” Take this mantra to heart today,
            Cancer. How do you connect with the world? No, not the internet world. The one we live, breathe, and exist
            in. When was the last time you walked barefoot on the grass? When did you let yourself tune into the sound
            of a bird or the wind in the leaves? Chances are, a little time spent in nature will provide you with the
            reset that you need. Should you feel inspired to take this a step further, look up local charities or
            clean-up drives.</div>
    </div>

    <div id="div5">
        <div id="i5"><img

        </div>
        <div id="c5">There’s always a lot of debate on whether attachment is a good or bad thing. Pop culture and trends
            are constantly oscillating between the importance of emotional investment. Today, you get tasked with taking
            a closer look at what you are consciously or subconsciously attached to. In the process of simply looking at
            these connections, you’ll know which cords need to be cut. Think of it this way, we cut our hair to let
            healthier locks grow in. As you clear away chapters that no longer resonate with you, new beginnings can
            come up for you. </div>
    </div>

    <div id="div6">
        <div id="i6"><img

                height="250px" width="250px" alt="virgo" />
        </div>
        <div id="c6">Today’s a good day to observe the trajectory of your year thus far. Sure, things haven’t always
            gone to plan. They seldom do, Virgo! But that’s only because there’s a higher plan in place, one that has to
            do with the choices you have made in the past. Take the time to be grateful for all that has led to this
            moment. Put on your best pajamas and your favourite romcom— you have a lot to gain from the simple act of
            laughter. </div>

    <div id="div7">
        <div id="i7"><img

                height="250px" width="250px" alt="libra" />
        </div>
        <div id="c7">We’re told tales of tunnels and lights that wait at the end. It’s an old adage that gets morphed
            into many tales but somehow isn’t very practical when you’re going through a tough time. Consider this: what
            do you learn from every painful experience? Today, you’re surrounded by healing energy. You're presented
            with an opportunity to let go of the weight of these past experiences and distil the wisdom that has come
            through. What will you do the next time you’re in the same situation, Libra?</div>
    </div>

    <div id="div8">
        <div id="i8"><img

                height="250px" width="250px" alt="scorpio" />
        </div>
        <div id="c8">This week presents a new challenge—how to be honest about your emotions without having to wear your
            heart on your sleeve. This isn’t a personal attack. Just a reminder that keeping things to yourself is doing
            you no favours. The key to healthy relationships lies in open communication. The moment you open up about
            what’s on your mind, you’ll realise the joy of sharing. Those who love you won’t judge you for it. Take
            stock of all that is good in your life and as you do, send a silent prayer of gratitude.</div>
    </div>

    <div id="div9">
        <div id="i9"><img
                src="https://image.shutterstock.com/image-vector/illustration-sagittarius-astrological-sign-beautiful-600w-1473374471.jpg"
                height="250px" width="250px" alt="sagittarius" />
        </div>
        <div id="c9">The guidance today is to listen to your intuition, Sagittarius. The answers you seek, you
            inherently know. We just tend to complicate things in the mayhem of our daily routine. Slow down and
            consider the first thoughts that come to you. This is the inner wisdom that’ll see you through any potential
            challenges. Have an open dialogue with what motivates you. What are you trying to attain in the long run and
            how can your actions today contribute to that goal?</div>
    </div>

    <div id="div10">
        <div id="i10"><img

                height="250px" width="250px" alt="capricon" />
        </div>
        <div id="c10">Magic in the mundane is your mantra for today! Think back to your childhood - how can you look at
            the world with that same fascination? Every fallen leaf has a story to tell. Every bird and squirrel calling
            out from your window has a message for you. Should you feel inspired to, look up the spiritual signifiers of
            anything that catches your fancy. Or attach your own meaning to these totems. And the next time you see
            them, know that the universe has your back!</div>
    </div>

    <div id="div11">
        <div id="i11"><img
                src="https://image.shutterstock.com/z/stock-vector-illustration-of-aquarius-astrological-sign-as-a-beautiful-girl-zodiac-vector-illustration-isolated-1473353045.jpg"
                height="250px" width="250px" alt="aquarius" />
        </div>
        <div id="c11">Pull out the collage paraphernalia and all the glitter pens today. The mood is one of dreaming.
            Dreaming go as big and as magical as you can! Ask yourself if you didn’t have the worldly things like
            resumes and investments and permits, what would you do? Make the vision board now and watch your wildest
            dreams come true. Your intentions are blessed by the Universe. Plus, your boldness will only be rewarded
            with this extra protection from the spirit world.</div>
    </div>

    <div id="div12">
        <div id="i12"><img
                src="https://image.shutterstock.com/z/stock-vector-illustration-of-pisces-astrological-sign-as-a-beautiful-girl-zodiac-vector-illustration-isolated-1473352226.jpg"
                height="250px" width="250px" alt="pisces" />
        </div>
        <div id="c12">Manifestation can be one of those oft-quoted words in conversation today, but the practice remains
            elusive. Consider this: there is no real rule book. As with a garden, what you sow is what you grow. That
            which you ask for with purity of heart, will eventually find its way to you. So, focus on what you want more
            of instead of giving into petty squabbles or battles of the ego.</div>
