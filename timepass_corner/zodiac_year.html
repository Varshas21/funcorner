        <div id="c1">The process of healing is seldom linear. There are all kinds of phases. Phases in which you feel
            like you’ve successfully made it to the other side and phases in which you feel like you’re drowning in a
            river of sadness. Hold space for it all, Aries. Watch what’s coming up with tenderness as you hold space for
            it all. Something tells us you are going to feel more *you* today than you have in a while now.

        </div>
        <div id="c2">The cards are bringing you attention to the law of karma or the principle of cause and effect.
            They’re urging you to be mindful of not just your words and actions, but also your thoughts and intentions
            you’re putting out there. Remembering that everything is energy in motion, and that everything has
            consequences will help you act from a space of awareness. You are the creator of your reality, Taurus, and
            you have the power to plant the seeds of knowledge and awareness.

        </div>
        <div id="c3">Gemini, you are infinite potential human form. We repeat: you are infinite potential in human form.
            So, instead of limiting yourself or confining yourself to a box, explore the possibility of who you can be.
            Spread your wings and give yourself the permission to explore undiscovered territories. Spirit is supporting
            you to ascend to the next level of your consciousness.

        </div>
        <div id="c4">It’s been one wake-up call after another, Cancer. One wake up call after another with no respite.
            Yes, your illusions will be shattered. No, the world as you know it will cease to exist. The discomfort is
            real but it’s also what is helping you level spiritually and become the most empowered version of yourself.
            So, embrace the unbecoming as you free yourself from the idea of who you should or shouldn’t be.

        </div>
        <div id="c5">The weekend sees you working through those abundance blocks, transmuting the negative thought
            patterns and calling in the wealth you desire and deserve. Your relationship with money hasn’t always been
            easy, but that doesn’t mean it cannot improve. What the Universe wants you to keep in mind, now and for the
            rest of your life: both your needs and your wants will be taken care of.

        </div>
        <div id="c6">A love like this one doesn’t come by every day, Virgo. A love like this one doesn’t come by every
            day. While you cannot control the outcome, you can surrender to the process. You can allow yourself to feel
            all the feels and actively work towards building a life together with them. PS: If this requires you to
            travel halfway across the world, so be it.

        <div id="c7">Rumour has it that you’re the most sociable of the signs. But, the truth is, even your social
            batteries run out every now and then. In fact, you revel in solo time as much as encounters with other
            people. So, surrender to the silence. Retreat into that womb space this weekend. Meditate, engage in
            breathwork, practice yoga, write poetry, and tend to your garden. Letting go of that goal-oriented approach
            will help you be in the moment.

        </div>
        <div id="c8">There comes a point in every seeker’s journey where they can continue to live as they have been or
            allow Spirit to come through and change the course. This is a major turning point for you, Scorpio. A time
            of recognising that you are one with the forces and that forces are dancing the dance of life through you.
            So, let go of that false sense of control. Surrender to the rhythm and feel the flow. The more you practice
            the art of surrender, the more effortlessly things will begin to come together for you.

        </div>
        <div id="c9">We all have our own set of masks, Sagittarius. Masks that we begin to derive our sense of identity
            from. Masks that then become a barrier between us and the outside world. Pay attention to how these masks
            are interfering with your relationship. Something tells us it’s time to dissolve the barriers, to allow
            yourself to melt and merge, and to experience the depths of this connection. There is a river beneath the
            river that is waiting to be discovered.

        </div>
        <div id="c10">Today, you’re raising a toast to all the things that didn’t work out, including the relationships
            you thought would last forever, beautiful. You understand that Spirit wasn’t punishing you. It was simply
            preparing you for a life of grandeur. On the professional front, you’re experiencing quite the wheel of
            fortune moment. A series of serendipitous encounters that are helping you level up *and* create the kind of
            wealth you desire and deserve.

        </div>
        <div id="c11">This is a time of inner blossoming, Aquarius. A time of shedding the old skin and coming into your
            own. The process of coming out of denial and into the light is seldom easy. So, give yourself the pat on the
            back you deserve. What you need to keep in mind as you move into the next phase of your life is that aspects
            of your old life will fall away. Allow what is coming undone to come undone as you become a witness of your
            circumstances.

        </div>
        <div id="c12">Let’s take a moment to check in with goals you set for yourself earlier this year. How many of
            those have you managed to check off your list and how many of them are still vying for your attention? This
            is not a time for drastic changes, Pisces. It’s time to realign with your path and purpose, and to create
            the life you truly desire. Commitment will be required of you at this point. That, and the ability to show
            up even when things seem topsy-turvy in your outer reality.
